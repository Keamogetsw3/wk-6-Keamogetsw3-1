## 1. Executive Summary
CleanCity is a web-based platform designed to streamline waste pickup scheduling for residents and this report will present the results of a comprehensive testing done by members of the KNS as part of the final project for the PowerLearn Project Software Testing & Quality Assurance course. Testing took place from 30 October 2025 to 18 November 2025, where manual and automated testing were used test the functionality, performance, usability, accessibility and security across the web application.

### 1.1 Key Finding:
- Core Functional Issues:
  - Authentication: System allows login with unregistered or invalid credentials.

### 1.2 Recommandation:
We have identified major issues that affect the core functionalities of the app, therefore, we as KNA QA team we **Recommend** that the app should **NOT BE RELEASED** until issues have been resolved. 

## 2. Objectives
As the KNS software testing team, our primary objective is to ensure that the CleanCity system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, functions reliably and is secure. Specifically, we aim to:

- Verify that all functional and non-functional requirements are met.
- Identify and document software defects with reproducible evidence.
- Ensure risk-based testing coverage of critical modules.
- Validate the system’s security, usability and compatibility across devices.
- Ensure the CleanCity application is fully ready for deployment.  


## 2. Overview of the CleanCity System

CleanCity is a web-based platform designed to streamline and modernize waste management operations for residents, waste collectors, and administrators. The system allows users to report waste issues, request collection services, track the status of their submissions, and communicate directly with the management team. Administrators can monitor reports, assign tasks, update progress, and analyze waste trends. The platform aims to improve city cleanliness, enhance reporting accuracy, reduce response time, and promote transparency and accountability in urban waste management. 


## 3. Scope of Testing

## 7. Defect Analysis and Categorization
During testing of the CleanCity system, a total of 58 defects were identified across (42) functional and (16) non-functional modules. Defects were categorised by severity, module, and type to assess system readiness and guide remediation efforts.

<img width="1366" height="768" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a827ff8-c81e-48c9-8b8d-b73eb2a2e07c" />

---

Defects were categorised based on severity, with testing identifying 3 critical, 39 major, 12 minor, and 3 cosmetic issues. This classification highlights the areas of highest risk, allowing the team to prioritise fixes and retesting, focusing first on critical and major defects to ensure the stability and reliability of the CleanCity system before release.

<img width="1366" height="768" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48fafebf-4612-4442-904f-dd42a1b1c69d" />

---

Most critical defects relate to login and authentication issues, while medium defects primarily involve scheduling and input validations. Non-functional and accessibility defects require UI and compliance fixes. Continuous monitoring is recommended for pending and in-progress defects to ensure timely resolution.

## 9. Overall Summary

### 9.1 Testing Summary
The CleanCity system underwent extensive testing across all major modules, with over 120 planned test cases executed. Testing covered functional areas such as registration, login, pickup scheduling, dashboard management, and community features. Several critical and major defects were discovered, especially in authentication, request management, and scheduling functionality. Non-functional testing also revealed issues in UI responsiveness and accessibility. Overall, testing provided strong coverage of system behavior and usability across different browsers and devices.


## 9.2 Quality Assessment
The overall quality of the system is improving, but it is not yet ready for deployment. Critical defects affecting login security, data validation, and request workflows reduce the stability and reliability of the application. Medium-level issues also impact user experience, particularly in scheduling and interface handling. While core workflows function conceptually, further refinement and bug resolution are required. The structure of the system shows strong potential once major issues are addressed.

## 10. Risk Assessment
- Authentication vulnerabilities that allow invalid or unregistered users to log in.
- Acceptance of invalid data, including pickup dates and oversized input fields.
- Missing or incomplete validation across critical workflows.
- UI inconsistencies across devices and screen sizes.
- Accessibility issues such as low contrast text and unresponsive navigation.
- Potential performance issues under increased system load.
- Incomplete backend features causing test blocks and pending cases.
- Risk of incorrect or delayed waste pickup due to flawed request management logic.

## 11. Release Recommendation
Based on current results, the system **SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED** in its current state. Critical and major defects must be resolved and retested before deployment. Key priorities for developers include fixing login validation, improving request handling logic, refining UI responsiveness, and completing missing backend functionalities. A full regression testing cycle will be required once fixes are implemented. Only after these actions can the system be considered ready for a reliable and stable release.

## 12. Testing Challenges
- Unstable test environment leading to inconsistent test results.
- Some system modules were still under development, causing incomplete or pending test cases.
- Delayed bug fixes slowed down regression testing cycles.
- Limited access to certain admin functionalities during the testing period.
- UI responsiveness varied across devices, requiring repeated cross-device checks.
- Difficulty reproducing certain defects due to intermittent system behavior.
- Lack of complete API documentation, making backend validation slower.
- Time constraints impacting the depth of non-functional and edge-case testing.
