## ⚠️ Risks Table

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|
| R001 | Registration & Login | Authentication errors, weak password validation, and incorrect credential handling | Medium | High | High | Add strong validation, implement secure API calls, and perform boundary testing |
| R002 | Pickup Scheduling | Form crashes on invalid date/time; incorrect pickup slot allocation | High | High | High | Enforce date/time validation, run functional and integration tests early |
| R003 | localStorage Data | Data loss or corruption during page reloads or session timeout | Medium | High | High | Regularly test localStorage persistence and implement backup saving logic |
| R004 | Admin Panel | Restricted access failure or role mismanagement | Medium | Medium | Medium | Implement role-based access control and validate admin endpoints |
| R005 | Blog & Community Features | Comment section or post creation may fail due to API errors | High | Medium | High | Conduct API testing and input sanitization; add retry logic |
| R006 | Form Validation | Missing field-level validation causing data entry errors | Medium | Medium | Medium | Add both client- and server-side validation with clear error prompts |
| R007 | Security | Unsecured API calls, lack of HTTPS, or potential XSS vulnerabilities | High | High | High | Apply HTTPS, sanitize inputs, and perform penetration testing |
| R008 | Performance & Load | Slow response or timeout during high user traffic | Medium | High | High | Conduct load and stress testing; optimize API responses |
| R009 | Mobile & Cross-browser | UI misalignment or functionality issues on smaller screens | Medium | Medium | Medium | Perform cross-device compatibility testing |
| R010 | Notifications & Alerts | Delayed or missing notifications for pickup confirmation | Medium | Medium | Medium | Test notification logic and set fallback messages |
| R011 | Offline & Network Issues | App fails to handle poor connectivity or offline mode | Low | Medium | Medium | Implement offline caching and retry mechanisms |
| R012 | Data Integrity & Backup | Missing database constraints or failed data backup | Medium | Medium | Medium | Enforce data integrity rules and schedule auto-backups |
| R013 | Dashboard & Analytics  | Failures in profile updates, following/unfollowing, feed loading, achievement sharing, or event participation caused by API errors, data sync issues, or UI inconsistencies | Medium         | High       | High         | Strengthen API validation, improve caching and synchronization logic, enforce privacy checks, perform end-to-end testing, and enable real-time error monitoring |
