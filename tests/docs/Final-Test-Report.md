## 1. Objectives

As the KNS software testing team, our objectives are to ensure the CleanCity system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, functions reliably, and is secure. We aim to detect defects early, validate performance under different conditions, enhance user experience, reduce operational risks, confirm overall quality, and ensure the CleanCity application is fully ready for deployment.

## 2. Overview of the CleanCity System

CleanCity is a web-based platform designed to streamline and modernize waste management operations for residents, waste collectors, and administrators. The system allows users to report waste issues, request collection services, track the status of their submissions, and communicate directly with the management team. Administrators can monitor reports, assign tasks, update progress, and analyze waste trends. The platform aims to improve city cleanliness, enhance reporting accuracy, reduce response time, and promote transparency and accountability in urban waste management.

## 3. Scope of Testing

The scope of testing covered the key functionalities of the CleanCity website, including core features such as registration, login, and waste collection requests. It also included validating admin dashboards and data management processes, performing functional, non-functional, UI, usability, security, and compatibility testing, testing across multiple devices and browsers, validating APIs, data accuracy, error handling, and system responses, as well as assessing performance under normal, peak, and extreme conditions to ensure full reliability and requirement compliance.  

The testing did not cover load testing beyond certain thresholds.

## 4. Test Environment

The testing environment included the frontend CleanCity web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend based on Node.js/Express. The database used was MySQL or MongoDB depending on the project configuration. Browsers tested included Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, while devices included Windows desktops and Android smartphones. Test data consisted of a mix of dummy data and realistic simulated user inputs. Tools used included GitHub for defect tracking and test case management, along with browser developer tools for debugging.
