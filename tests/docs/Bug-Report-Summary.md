## 🐛 Reported Bugs

### 🐞 BUG-001
- **Title:** Profile shows email username instead of Full Name after registration  
- **GitHub Link:** [D001](https://github.com/Keamogetsw3/CleanCity-Waste_Pickup_Scheduler-QATesting/issues/28)  
- **Requirement Affected:** User Registration – Profile Display  
- **Severity:** Cosmetic  
- **Environment:** Development, Google Chrome, Windows 10  

#### Summary
After registering a new user with a proper Full Name, the profile page displays the username portion of the email (e.g., `user1` from `newuser@test.com`) instead of the Full Name (`New Test User`) provided during registration. This may cause confusion for users, as the system does not reflect the actual name they entered.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the CleanCity application in Google Chrome.
2. Click on Register to register a new profile
3.  Register a new user with:  
   - **Full Name:** `New Test User`  
   - **Email:** `newuser@test.com`  
   - **Password:** `NewPass123`  
3. Log in with the newly registered account.  
4. Navigate to the **User Profile** page.  
5. Observe that the profile shows the email username instead of the Full Name.

#### Expected Result
The profile page should display the **Full Name** entered during registration.

#### Actual Result
The profile page displays the **username derived from the email** instead of the Full Name.

- **Severity:** Critical  
- **Environment:** Development, Google Chrome, Windows 10

3.  Register a new user:  
   - Full Name: Test User

4. Log out.  
5. Attempt to log in using the same email but a different password (e.g., WrongPassword).  
6. Observe the system allows login despite the incorrect password.

#### Expected Result
The system should reject login attempts when the password does not match the one used during registration, displaying an error: "Invalid email or password."

#### Actual Result
The system allows login even with a different password.
