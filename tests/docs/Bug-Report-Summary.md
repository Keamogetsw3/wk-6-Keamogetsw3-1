### 🐞 BUG-001
**Title**: Profile shows email username instead of Full Name after registration
GitHub Link: 
Requirement Affected: User Registration – Profile Display
Severity: Low

Summary:
After registering a new user with a proper Full Name, the profile page displays the username portion of the email (e.g., user1 from user1@test.com) instead of the Full Name (Jane Doe) provided during registration. This may cause confusion for users, as the system does not reflect the actual name they entered.

Steps to Reproduce:

- Register a new user with a:
  - valid Full Name = New Test User
  - email = newuser@test.com
  - password = NewPass123
- Log in with the newly registered account.
- Navigate to the user profile page.
- Observe that the profile shows the email username instead of the Full Name.

Expected Result:
The profile page should display the Full Name entered during registration.

Actual Result:
The profile page displays the username derived from the email instead of the Full Name.
