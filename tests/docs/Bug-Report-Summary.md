## 🐛 Reported Bugs

### 🐞 BUG-001
**Title:** Profile shows email username instead of Full Name after registration  
**GitHub Link:** #28  
**Requirement Affected:** User Registration – Profile Display  
**Severity:** Low  

---

#### Summary
After registering a new user with a proper Full Name, the profile page displays the username portion of the email (e.g., `user1` from `newuser@test.com`) instead of the Full Name (`New Test User`) provided during registration. This may cause confusion for users, as the system does not reflect the actual name they entered.

---

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Register a new user with:
   - **Full Name:** `New Test User`
   - **Email:** `newuser@test.com`
   - **Password:** `NewPass123`
2. Log in with the newly registered account.  
3. Navigate to the **User Profile** page.  
4. Observe that the profile shows the email username instead of the Full Name.

---

#### Expected Result
The profile page should display the **Full Name** entered during registration.

---

#### Actual Result
The profile page displays the **username derived from the email** instead of the Full Name.
