- **Requirement Affected:** User Registration – Profile Display  
- **Severity:** Cosmetic  
- **Environment:** Development, Google Chrome, Windows 10

After registering a new user with a proper Full Name, the profile page displays the username portion of the email (e.g., `user1` from `newuser@test.com`) instead of the Full Name (`New Test User`) provided during registration. This may cause confusion for users, as the system does not reflect the actual name they entered.

#### Steps to Reproduce

2. Click on Register to register a new profile
3.  Register a new user with:  
   - **Full Name:** `New Test User`

   - **Password:** `NewPass123`  
3. Log in with the newly registered account.  
4. Navigate to the **User Profile** page.  
5. Observe that the profile shows the email username instead of the Full Name.

#### Expected Result
The profile page should display the **Full Name** entered during registration.

#### Actual Result
The profile page displays the **username derived from the email** instead of the Full Name.
