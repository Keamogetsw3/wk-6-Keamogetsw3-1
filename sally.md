### 🧭 Summary of Adjustments
- ✅ **Updated Risk Links** to match your official risk register (R001–R012).  
- 🔺 **Added new tests** for **offline handling (R011)** and **data integrity (R012)**.  
- ⚙️ **Merged and refined performance/security cases** based on high-priority risks (R007, R008).  
- 📱 **Cross-browser & accessibility** tests now linked correctly to **R009 (Mobile & Cross-browser)**.
